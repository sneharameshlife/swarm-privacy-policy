  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This project is a private internal tool used only to manage and publish content for Facebook and Instagram accounts that we own. We do not offer this service to external customers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User ID and basic public profile information for account owners/admins.</li>
    <li>Facebook Page IDs and Instagram Business account IDs necessary for publishing.</li>
    <li>Access tokens required to interact with the Facebook/Instagram APIs (stored encrypted).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <p>Data and tokens are used only to publish content to our own Facebook Pages / Instagram Business accounts and to read related metrics for those accounts.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share this data with external parties. Third‑party providers (e.g., Facebook) receive only the information required to perform API operations.</p>

  <h2>Retention & revocation</h2>
  <p>Tokens and related data are retained only as long as needed to operate our accounts. You can revoke access at any time by removing the app's access in your Facebook account settings or by contacting the address above.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Access tokens and sensitive data are stored encrypted and access is limited to authorized team members and systems only.</p>
